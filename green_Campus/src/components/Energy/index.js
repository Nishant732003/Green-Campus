                Cool roofs coated with materials containing specialized pigments
                reflect sunlight and absorb less heat than standard roofs.
                Expect these types of roof systems to get even “cooler” due to
                new fluorescent pigments developed by Lawrence Berkeley National
                Laboratory and PPG Industries that can reflect nearly four times
                the amount of sunlight of standard pigments

                The same concept behind heat pump technologies that keep your
                home comfortable can also be used for another important
                application: drying your clothes. Oak Ridge National Laboratory
                and General Electric are developing a new type of clothes dryer
                that uses a heat pump cycle to generate hot air needed for
                drying. The result: a more efficient dryer that has the
                potential to lower energy consumption by 60 percent compared to
                conventional ones on the market today.

                The Building Technologies Office is ushering in the next
                generation of heat pump systems, which warm and cool your home
                by moving heat from one space to another. These include: A
                fuel-fired, multi-function residential heat pump that can reduce
                primary energy consumption by 30 percent. A natural gas heat
                pump and air conditioner that uses an ultra-low-emission
                combustion burner and other equipment to provide home heating,
                cooling and hot water. A low-cost gas heat pump designed to
                reduce heating costs by 30 to 45 percent compared to
                conventional gas furnaces and boilers.

                We live in an increasingly connected world the same is true for
                our homes. New electronic devices and appliances can now be
                linked to the Internet to provide real-time data that makes it
                easier to understand and lower energy use. Soon these
                technologies will be more cost effective and smarter as a result
                of a project supported by the Energy Department’s Building
                Technologies Office. New wireless sensors developed at Oak Ridge
                National Laboratory will boost home energy efficiency through
                automated control systems for heating and cooling units,
                lighting and other systems that access data such as outside air
                and room temperature, humidity, light level and occupancy all at
                a fraction of a cost of typical wireless sensors you see on the
                market today.
